  <h1>Explanations and guides for pure mathematicians</h1>
  <p>Many guides online are following the <em>engineer principal</em> , i.e. &quot;to teach what is needed to solve the problem&quot;. This will make an useful and efficient guide for most of the time. But I have never been satisified by such guide. I am just too used to the pure mathematics way of teaching, namely building step by step from the underlying structure.</p>
  <p>This series of blogs is to provide explanation and guides of complicated real world concepts in a more logical and comprehensive manner. It will not be the most suitable for solving a problem, but it will be precise and prograssive. I hope it can help anyone like me</p>
